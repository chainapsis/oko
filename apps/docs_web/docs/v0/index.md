Web3 onboarding does not need to be complicated. Oko makes onboarding to your
application easy, fast, and secure. No wallet installs, no recovery phrases, no
friction. It is a fully open source embedded wallet stack that teams can self
host, inspect, and customize from end to end.

Oko integrates the security of non custodial wallets directly into any web or
mobile application. Users sign up with familiar login methods like email or
social, while the wallet keys are protected by a distributed TSS plus SSS
architecture. Private keys are never constructed, never stored, and never
accessible by any single party.

## Why Oko

One of the biggest challenges in crypto is managing wallets across multiple
chains. Keplr (the team behind Oko) has solved this with **a browser extension**
that empowers users to securely self-custody their assets and connect
effortlessly to dApps across ecosystems.

However, onboarding remains one of the biggest barriers for users who are less
familiar with crypto. In Web3, the core advantage is that users bring their own
wallet to every application—unlike Web2, where accounts are tied to individual
platforms. But this Web3 model introduces two major challenges:

- Managing recovery phrases or private keys
- Installing browser extensions or mobile apps

Embedded wallets aim to remove these hurdles by providing a smoother entry
point. Yet, existing solutions sacrifice one of Web3’s defining strengths:
_interoperability across applications and blockchains_. They tend to create
isolated accounts for each application, essentially reverting to a Web2-style
model.

**Oko** solves this by providing an embedded onboarding flow that still
preserves the interoperability of a global wallet address. Developers keep full
control of the integration because everything from client to server is open
source under Apache 2.0. Teams can run Oko entirely on their own infrastructure
or choose official integration to use enterprise grade key share nodes and
dashboards.
