# Supported Chains

Oko supports both Cosmos-SDK-based chains and EVM-based chains. Chain
metadata (IDs, names, currencies, RPCs, images, etc.) is sourced from the
open-source Keplr Chain Registry. Contributions are welcome — you can add or
update chains via pull requests.

- Registry: https://github.com/chainapsis/keplr-chain-registry

## Ecosystems

- Cosmos: Chains identified like `cosmoshub-4`, `osmosis-1`, etc.
- EVM: Chains identified via CAIP-2 like `eip155:1` (Ethereum), `eip155:10`
  (Optimism), `eip155:8453` (Base), etc.

> Note: If a chain exists in the registry, Oko can discover and use
> it automatically. If your chain isn’t there yet, add it via PR (see below).

## Add or Update a Chain

1. Check the registry for your chain
   - Cosmos directory: `cosmos/`
   - EVM directory: `evm/`

2. Prepare the chain JSON and assets per the registry’s requirements
   - Provide chain ID, RPC/REST endpoints, currencies, images, etc.

3. Open a PR to `keplr-chain-registry`
   - The Keplr team will review and merge.

Once merged, Oko SDK will pick it up automatically in the next fetch
cycle (no app update needed).

:::warning Custom chains
Adding chains dynamically via SDK methods such as `wallet_switchEthereumChain` or Keplr’s
[`experimentalSuggestChain`](https://docs.keplr.app/api/guide/suggest-chain) is
not supported yet in Oko. This capability is planned for a future
update.
