# Integration Overview

Oko is currently in beta and only available to teams approved through
our partnerships process. _If you'd like to integrate it into your dApp, please
fill out and submit [this form](https://form.typeform.com/to/MxrBGq9b)._

## Compatibility

Oko can be used alongside existing wallet connection methods,
including the Keplr browser extension and mobile app.

Integration is simple. Just add Google Login to your onboarding flow to get
started. Currently, only Google Login is supported, but upcoming updates will
allow users to connect wallets they already have installed, such as Keplr and
MetaMask.

## Create an Account

Once your integration is confirmed, our Partnerships team will send you a
temporary password to access the
[_Oko dApp Dashboard_](https://dapp.oko.app). Use the email
address you provided during the partnership process as your login ID. When you
sign in for the first time, you'll receive a verification code via email. Enter
the code to proceed, and you'll be prompted to set a new password.

At the time of login, you should be able to see the API key that has already
been issued to you.

After logging in, visit the _Initial Setup_ section to begin configuration.
Detailed setup instructions are covered in the
[Quick Start Guide](./quick-start.md).

## Why Choose Oko?

Most wallets rely on a **single private key** that can be stolen, lost, or
compromised. Oko uses **threshold signatures** to eliminate this
single point of failure while providing a superior user experience.

### Traditional Wallets vs. Oko

| Traditional Wallets                      | Oko                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔐 Single private key controls all funds | 🔒 **Distributed key shares** - no single private key exists         |
| 🧩 Browser extension required            | 🚀 **Embedded in your application** - no extensions needed           |
| 🔄 Complex user onboarding               | ⚡ **Google OAuth login** - simple and familiar                      |
| ⚠️ Single point of failure               | 🛡️ **Cryptographically impossible** for single party to access funds |

**Key Benefits:**

- **🔒 Enhanced Security** - Threshold signatures eliminate single points of
  failure
- **🚀 Better UX** - Seamless integration without browser extensions
