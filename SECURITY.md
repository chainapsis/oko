# Security Policy

We value responsible disclosure and the researchers who help keep Oko secure.

## Supported versions
- `main` (upcoming release)
- Latest stable release (older minors for critical issues at maintainers’ discretion)

## Report a vulnerability
- Email ``
- Or open a private GitHub Security Advisory: *Security → Advisories → Report a vulnerability*

Include a short description, impact, affected versions, and reproduction steps if possible. Please avoid opening public issues.

## Disclosure
- We practice coordinated disclosure and credit reporters unless anonymity is requested.
- No monetary bounty program is offered.
- Out of scope: social engineering, volumetric DoS, issues in unsupported third-party software, or findings requiring privileged/local access beyond our threat model.

Thanks for helping protect the Oko community.
