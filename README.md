# Oko

[![Oko Wallet](https://oko-wallet.s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/assets/oko-github-readme.png)](https://demo.oko.app)

Oko is an open-source embedded wallet stack that gives developers full control
over authentication, signing, and key management architecture.

## Key Features and Architecture

Everything is fully open source and Apache-2.0 licensed:

- Non-custodial, based on Multi-Party Computation (MPC)

- Key Management: Hybrid signing model utilizing TSS (Threshold Signature
  Scheming) plus SSS (Shamir’s Secret Sharing)

- Key Security: Signatures are generated via distributed key shares; private key
  never reconstructed.

- User Onboarding: Supports email/social logins; eliminates seed phrases and
  browser extensions.

- Unified Account: Unified global wallet address with native multichain support.

- Modular Architecture: Orchestrator, adaptors, MPC services, and signing logic
  are self-hostable and auditable.

## Integration and Support

- Official Integration: Access enterprise-grade key share infrastructure,
  dedicated monitoring and operational support, and comprehensive Dapp Dashboard
  and User Dashboard interfaces.

- Self-Host (Open Source): Utilize the Apache 2.0 components for complete
  architectural control and customization.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Postgres 17+

#### pg_dump

During development, key share node assumes the system has "pg_dump" executable.
pg_dump should be installed while installing Postgres. One way to install on
MacOS is as follows.

```sh
brew install postgresql@18
echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/postgresql@18/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

### Continuous integration (CI)

Please refer to `internals/ci`. It is where the commands that can be executed to
automate some processes are.

Notable CI commands include the following.

- `yarn ci deps_check`, to check the NodeJS dependencies across the repository
- `yarn ci lang_format`, to format NodeJS code across the repository
